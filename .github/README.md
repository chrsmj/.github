# Freedom to Communicate 🐸

The “Free” in FreePBX stands for Freedom. That’s because FreePBX, the world’s most popular open source IP PBX, gives users the tools to build a phone system tailored to their needs.

## Lay of the Land 🗺️

Since late 2023, the FreePBX project uses separate GitHub repositories for issue tracking, security reporting, the FreePBX version 17 installer for Debian 12, and the many open source modules that make FreePBX *extremely configurable*.

## Contributions 💝

We welcome your ideas!

Please submit open source issue reports, patches, and suggestions via the [Issue Tracker repo](https://github.com/FreePBX/issue-tracker); but for security issues please use the [Security Reporting repo](https://github.com/FreePBX/security-reporting?tab=security-ov-file).

Inside your patch comment in any specific module repo, you can link back to specific issues in the issue-tracker repo with a line like `Bugfix FreePBX/issue-tracker#XYZ` where `XYZ` is the issue number.
